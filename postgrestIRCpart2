[05:49:21]  <Meraki>	RhodiumToad I'm a Computer Science student and after your wizardry last night, I wanna learn and master Postgres. Do you have any recommendations on what resources I should refer to?/

[05:54:13]  <pagnol>	Meraki, maybe the sources would be a good start? https://github.com/postgres/postgres
[05:54:53]  <peerce>	i'd suggest writing a series of increasingly complex applications that use SQL, best way to learn is by doing.

[05:55:38]  <davidfetter>	Meraki, what would you like to work on first?

[05:58:04]  <Meraki>	peerce davidfetter I learn better by doing. So I think I wanna build a social network, sounds about the right amount of complexity for me. Any resouces or suggestions on where to write queries involving complex relations between tables are welcome.
[05:58:29]  <Meraki>	*how
[05:59:50]  <davidfetter>	so you want to build something with SQL. great! any graph query (how many friends am I away from person X, for example) would probably count as "advanced"

[06:00:14]  <davidfetter>	hrm. that second one didn't pull up the stuff I'd hoped it would
[06:35:39]  <davidfetter>	recursive CTEs. I tend to keep the graph (edge) stuff in tables separate from the nodes (users, for example)
